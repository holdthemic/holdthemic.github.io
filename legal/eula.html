    <strong>Limitations to the App and the Services</strong>
    - The App and the Services are provided for general information and
    entertainment purposes only. They do not offer advice on which you should
    rely. You must obtain professional or specialist advice before taking, or
    refraining from, any action based on information obtained from the
    App or the Service. Although we make reasonable efforts to update the
    information provided by the App and the Service, we make no
    representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that
    such information is accurate, complete or up to date.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Please back-up content and data used with the App</strong>
    - We recommend that you back up any content and data used in connection
    with the App, to protect yourself in case of problems with the App or the
    Service.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Check that the App and the Services are suitable for you</strong>
    - The App and the Services have not been developed to meet your individual
    requirements. Please check that the facilities and functions of the App and
    the Services (as described on the App Store site and in the Documentation)
    meet your requirements.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We are not responsible for events outside our control</strong>
     - If our provision of the Services or support for the App or the Services is
    delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as
    possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of
    the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by
    the event but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to
    end your contract with us and receive a refund for any Services you have
    paid for but not received.
</p>
<h2>
        We may end your rights to use the App and the Services if you break
        these terms
    </h2>
<p>
    We may end your rights to use the App and Services at any time by
    contacting you if you have broken these terms in a serious way. If what you
    have done can be put right we will give you a reasonable opportunity to do
    so.
</p>
<p>
    If we end your rights to use the App and Services:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            You must stop all activities authorised by these terms, including
            your use of the App and any Services.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            You must delete or remove the App from all devices in your
            possession and immediately destroy all copies of the App which you
            have and confirm to us that you have done this.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            We may remotely access your devices and remove the App from them
            and cease providing you with access to the Services.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>We may transfer this agreement to someone else</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another
    organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and we
    will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the
    contract.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to
    another person if we agree in writing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>No rights for third parties</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights
    of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this agreement.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue
        in force
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or
    relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining
    paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it
        later
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later.
    If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do
    under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of
    your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do
    those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you later.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Which laws apply to this contract and where you may bring legal
        proceedings
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings
    in respect of the products in the English courts. If you live in Scotland
    you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the
    Scottish or the English courts. If you live in Northern Ireland you can
    bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the Northern
    Irish or the English courts.
</p>
<p>
	If you are a business, this contract, their subject matter and their
    formation (and any non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed by 
    English law. We both agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of 
    England and Wales.
<p>
    <strong>Alternative dispute resolution</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Alternative dispute resolution is a process where an independent body
    considers the facts of a dispute and seeks to resolve it, without you
    having to go to court. If you are not happy with how we have handled any
    complaint, you may want to contact the alternative dispute resolution
    provider we use. You can submit a complaint to ADR Group via
    their website (see <a href="http://www.consumer-dispute.co.uk">http://www.consumer-dispute.co.uk</a>). ADR Group will not charge
    you for making a complaint and if you are not satisfied with the outcome
    you can still bring legal proceedings. In addition, please note that
    disputes may be submitted for online resolution to the European Commission
    Online Dispute Resolution platform.
